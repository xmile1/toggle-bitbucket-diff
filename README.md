# toggle-bitbucket-diff
Toggle Bitbucket diff files just like you do on Github and Gitlab

This adds a toggle functionality to each diff file in your Bitbucket's pull request and commits diff view Just like you have in Github and Gitlab.

I needed it so i wrote it and thought to share incase someone else does.

Hoping www.bitbucket.org will eventually adds this feature to their awesome app.
